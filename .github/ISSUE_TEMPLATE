Steps to create a milestone:

1. Populate the sections below. and hit "Submit new issue".
2. Now we know the issue number, edit it to fix the URL at the bottom.
3. Then, add it to the "Tools Team" project:
   - Set the "Status" to "Milestone".
   - Set the "MS" to a number equalling this issue number.
4. Then, add it to the "Parity Roadmap" project:
   - Set the "Status" to "Open".
   - Set the "Team" to "Tools".
   - Set the "Deadline" to the month that this will be done by (speak to James if unsure).

Now we have a milestone, go to our project board: https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/22.
- Click on the MS number; it'll filter everything else out.
- Now, click the "+ Add item" in the "Todo" column to add issues for this milestone.
