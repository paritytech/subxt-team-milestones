# tools-team-milestones

A meta repository which tracks all active Tools Team milestones via issues.

Each issue follows a set template, and links to the tools team project board where you can see the progress of any sub tasks.

If you're a member of the tools team and would like to add a new milestone, click "create new issue" and follow the template guidelines.
