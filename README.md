# tools-team-tracking-issues

A meta repository which tracks all active tools team milestones via issues.

We'd like to represent all of our milestones as github milestones within our various repositories. However, github project boards don't support milestone cards being added directly to them. So, in this repository, we create issues corresponding to each milestone across our projects which _can_ be added to a project roadmap.

Hopefully this can be fully automated eventually, so that a script can scrape all of our project milestones and add/update the issues that mirror them.
