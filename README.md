# tools-team-milestones

This repository exists only as an area to help sync github milestones in repositories of interest to our project boards.

See https://github.com/jsdw/gh-tools-project-sync for the tool used to do the syncing and details of what it does.

**Everything is automated, so it should be rare that you will need to create any issues here yourself.**

That said, you can feel free to comment on, or assign yourself to, any of the issues created here to discuss or make it clear that you're working on a given milestone.
